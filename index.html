<li><img src="data1/images/5.jpg" alt=""Split" Feedback Kiosk" title=""Split" Feedback Kiosk" id="wows1_1"/>Old customers/Frequent Flyers - "Will work for miles."…….New/Leisure customers - "Give feedback & spin the wheel for prizes".  Idea here is that Frequent Flyers want to see core functionality fixed and firmed up; they will be there regardless because of earned loyalty miles.  New/Leisure customers want a new experience, incentives, & the entertainment factor (see Market Differentiation section below)</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/6.jpg" alt="Pop-Up Video" title="Pop-Up Video" id="wows1_2"/>Enhance Airline's "Glass Bottom Jet" on iPad to show more information about what you are flying over.  Think VH-1's "Pop-Up video" as you travel.</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/7.jpg" alt="Words w/Passengers" title="Words w/Passengers" id="wows1_3"/>Words With Friends???  How about playing the exciting word-find game against a random passenger on your same flight!</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/8.jpg" alt="Flight vs. Flight" title="Flight vs. Flight" id="wows1_4"/>Imagine the passengers on Flt #DL1746 from Miami to Atlanta engaging in a head to head trivia battle with the passengers on Flt #DL902 every day the week leading up to the big game between the Miami Dolphins and the Atlanta Falcons! Random head to head flights...Sports City rivalries...it doesn't matter! The passengers will just get a kick out of competing.  Even keep Flt.# head to head stats and inform the passengers before the flight begins.</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/9.jpg" alt="Fly the Plane Simulator" title="Fly the Plane Simulator" id="wows1_5"/>On board flight SIM. Passengers try to fly the plane and compete amongst each other and maybe with the pilot to see who wins (smooth landing, fuel consumption etc etc could win/lose points)</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/10.jpg" alt="Mitigate the stress" title="Mitigate the stress" id="wows1_6"/>Whenever a flight is delayed stress levels rise. The thought that you could easily check what the status is and what the options are, while you're in flight would be awesome. Take the stress away and make me feel like I have some level of control.</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/11.jpg" alt="Overbooking Advisor" title="Overbooking Advisor" id="wows1_7"/>Let you know when you are on an overbooked flight and might be asked to trade your ticket.  That way if you could easily delay your flight, you could make alternate plans and pocket the incentive.</li>

<li><img src="data1/images/16.png" alt="Know my Bag" title="Know my Bag" id="wows1_12"/>Will I have to gate check my bag because it's a small plane?</li>

<li><img src="data1/images/19.jpg" alt="Social Network Check-Ins" title="Social Network Check-Ins" id="wows1_15"/>When I log into the mobile app allows me to check-in based on my location and push to my social profiles like Facebook, Four Square, Twitter, etc</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/20.jpg" alt="SNAFU Tools" title="SNAFU Tools" id="wows1_16"/>I use mobile apps most when things are going wrong. Flight delays. Cancelled flights. Missed connections. Today I use a combination of apps to figure out if my delayed flight is leaving (by seeing where the plane is—e.g. recently stuck at DCA and saw that my inbound plane had been redirected to IAD because of weather and so there was no way my flight was leaving when the airline said it was) and to figure out alternate routes (ITA Flight Matrix, Kayak), and then CALL customer service to get rebooked.

No reason the Airline app couldn't integrate all of that—e.g. show me the offical delay info (can't trust that) and inbound flight info, let me track where my actual plane is, let me search alternate routings, and let me rebook them. 

And all of this should be _status_ aware. There are things as a Platinum I can talk them into (like flying me YYZ->DFW->PDX on American Airlines when the YYZ->DTW->PDX I had booked was all messed up) that I don't think non-status folks can.</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/21.jpg" alt="Instant feedback" title="Instant feedback" id="wows1_17"/>"How was your flight?" feedback form / pop-up just prior to landing - fields adjusted based on both length of flight and status / frequency of flying of passenger.

tell me the nearest power plugs and if they are free :)
auto check me in as i approach the airport and offer alternate flights</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/23.jpg" alt="Charitable Skymiles Donations" title="Charitable Skymiles Donations" id="wows1_19"/>What about a feature that would allow me to donate the miles for a flight to a charity of my choice.  Trust me, its far easier to feel charitable in small increments than large ones.  I think Airline would be amazed at the influx of miles if they did this.  And everyone wins!!!</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/24.jpg" alt="Picture of Parking spot" title="Picture of Parking spot" id="wows1_20"/>within a given trip take a picture/write  a note about where you parked. This is in the AA app but not United and is GREAT</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/25.png" alt="Free Wifi" title="Free Wifi" id="wows1_21"/>Can we just have this everywhere - it's so cheap so give it to us at the gate, on the plane anywhere where we have to wait around for a Airline plane</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/26.png" alt="Wifi for Miles" title="Wifi for Miles" id="wows1_22"/>"Give a burn rate such as 10 points per minute. I would totally spend 1500 points for a 150 minute flight. In the days of point inflation, seems like
 win-win for everyone"</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/27.jpg" alt="VIP Lounge App" title="VIP Lounge App" id="wows1_23"/>Not just some single brand app saying "Check out our VIP lounges!" - but rather, something that allows me to either slice all the lounges and what card/pass/ticket requirements to access them at a connecting or departing airport, or the other way, show me all the lounges based on a profile I've created or flight I've got entered. Often people have access to lounges and don't know it based on things like, for example, a privileged bank card or hotel group membership. I'd love something that tells me when the stuff I have meets requirements for a VIP lounge and there's one in the airport I'm going through!</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/30.jpg" alt="Airline "iBeacon"" title="Airline "iBeacon"" id="wows1_24"/>utilizing Mac iOS 7's "iBeacon" proximity technology to 1) welcome customers to the gate on their mobile device, 2) automatic pushes to get on waiting/upgrade lists when in proximity of departure gate, 3) automatic coupons if a flight departure is delayed, 4) Passenger Tracking....ANY MORE iBeacon uses???</li>

Having to save ticket stubs and do it some time later seems a waste of time and a way for the airline to avoid giving the miles. I know this automatically happens if I have booked and presented my card but sometimes I don't have the member id when I buy or the Oz Travel team book for me so I have to manually do this later.</li>
<li><img src="data1/images/82.jpg" alt="Baggage Tracking" title="Baggage Tracking" id="wows1_38"/>baggage tracking if I have a multi-stop flight where my bags are being transferred. I always get very paranoid that my bag is not on the second plane.</li>

<li><img src="data1/images/42.jpg" alt="In-flight app/experience" title="In-flight app/experience" id="wows1_41"/>"Piggybacking on the above suggestions I would love to have either a seperate ""inflight"" app or
have the app switch to ""in-flight"" mode. I would love to see both the above features and potentially some others that really
empower the user and address the different set of needs when on a flight (trip info, call attendant, distance/time remaining,
notes from the crew. I think that the Virgin inflight experience is nice step in that direction but you can achieve the same or
 better by allowing customers to use their own devices while saving hardware costs."</li>
